Codecool Web module, 5th SI week homework:

The web application shows information about the Star Wars universe (planets and their residents) using SWAPI, the public Star Wars API
- the assignment focused on practicing AJAX calls and DOM-manipulation with JavaScript.
Users can register and after a successful login they can vote on their favourite planets. Python's Flask micro-framework
is used on the server-side, users and their votes are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Authentication is handled via sessions.
